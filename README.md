## What I Do

I build robust, maintainable software using the Microsoft **.NET** tech stack. My approach focuses on:

- Use case-driven methodologies and clean architecture
- Fluent syntax libraries and expressive code
- Comprehensive testing with **Playwright**
- Thorough requirements engineering

## Philosophy

> *"The best NuGet package is the one you don't need."*

I believe in leveraging what's already built into .NET before adding dependencies. When MediatR went commercial, I decided to finally build my own use case-based library instead, inspired by MediatR and combining the functional approach of my previous library, FunctionalProcessing.

## When I'm Not Coding
- Running trails and streets
- Being dad to two amazing kids (my real full-time job)

*Always open to discussing .NET architecture, testing strategies, or book recommendations! This incredibly cringy page has been created with AI, because i'm too lazy to write all this out by hand and you are too lazy to read it anyway.*
