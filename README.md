## What I Do

I build robust, maintainable software using the Microsoft **.NET** tech stack. My approach focuses on:

- 🎯 Use case-driven methodologies and clean architecture
- ✨ Fluent syntax libraries and expressive code
- 🧪 Comprehensive testing with **Playwright**
- 📋 Thorough requirements engineering

## Philosophy

> *"The best NuGet package is the one you don't need."*

I believe in leveraging what's already built into .NET before adding dependencies. When MediatR went commercial, I decided to finally build my own use case-based library instead, inspired by MediatR and combining the functional approach of my previous library, FunctionalProcessing.

## When I'm Not Coding
- 🏃‍♂️ Running trails and streets
- 👨‍👧‍👦 Being dad to two amazing kids (my real full-time job)
- 📚 Reading sci-fi horror novels (the weirder, the better)
- 🎵 Creating music in Ableton Live

*Always open to discussing .NET architecture, testing strategies, or book recommendations!*
